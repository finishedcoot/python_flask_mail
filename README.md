# python_flask_mail
A flask backend with python to send a form information as an email.
this is just the backend server, there is no form included but you can use it in as your backend for any form(I used it for my react.js project).

since flask is being used you have to install it as a dependency(pip install flask --save)

more explanation is available via comment in the app file.
